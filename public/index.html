		<h1>Hello there.</h1>
		<p>This project is essentially a UI fiddle for hacking super-slow or ugly sites where you'll be tweaking js/css/html just to get the look right.. Ex: When you're working with clients who don't want to give you access, or are running on crappy servers (ex: plone, or that "other" php cms)</p>
		
		<p>You can save the page you're working on and put it in `/public` or just dump whatever you like into it. It should serve up the contents just fine.</p>
		<p>PS. The root html file should be names `index.html`</p>
		<p>PPS. Live reload should automatically inject.</p>
